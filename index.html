<h2>What is a tornado and how do they form?</h2>
 <p class="what">Tornadoes are powerful and destructive rotating columns of air that extend from a thunderstorm cloud to the ground. They
are often described as violent, twisting and funnel-shaped, and are capable of causing significant damage to everything
in their path. Tornadoes are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and lightning, and can occur in almost any
part of the world, but they are most common in the central and southern parts of the United States, where warm, moist
air from the Gulf of Mexico meets cooler air from the north.

Tornadoes are measured on the Fujita scale, which ranges from F0 (weak) to F5 (extreme), based on the damage they cause.
F5 tornadoes are capable of causing catastrophic damage and can have wind speeds of over 200 mph. Despite their
destructive power, tornadoes typically only last a few minutes and usually have a path length of a few miles, although
some can last for over an hour and travel hundreds of miles.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">F1 tornado</h5>
        <p class="card-text">An F1 tornado is a type of tornado that is categorized as "weak" on the Fujita scale. It has wind speeds between 73 and
        112 mph, which is strong enough to cause damage to poorly constructed buildings, uproot trees, and overturn mobile
        homes. <br>
        
        Some examples of the damage that an F1 tornado can cause include: <br>
        
        - Shallow-rooted trees uprooted or snapped <br>
        - Damage to the roofs of poorly constructed homes and buildings <br>
        - Mobile homes overturned <br>
        - Small outbuildings, sheds, and barns damaged or destroyed <br>
        
        F1 tornadoes are relatively common and typically cause less damage than stronger tornadoes. However, it is still
        important to take tornado warnings seriously and take appropriate shelter when necessary, as even weaker tornadoes can
        cause significant harm and injury.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">F2 tornado</h5>
        <p class="card-text">An F2 tornado is a type of tornado that is categorized as "significant" on the Fujita scale. It has wind speeds between
        113 and 157 mph, which is strong enough to cause considerable damage to well-constructed homes, uproot large trees, and
        overturn vehicles. <br>
        
        Some examples of the damage that an F2 tornado can cause include: <br>
        
        - Roofs of well-constructed homes and buildings severely damaged or torn off <br>
        - Large trees uprooted or snapped <br>
        - Cars overturned and moved considerable distances <br>
        - Mobile homes completely destroyed <br>
        
        F2 tornadoes are less common than weaker tornadoes, but they are still capable of causing significant damage and
        injuries. It is essential to take tornado warnings seriously and take appropriate shelter when necessary, regardless of
        the strength of the tornado..</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">F3 tornado</h5>
            <p class="card-text">An F3 tornado is a type of tornado that is categorized as "severe" on the Fujita scale. It is considered a strong
            tornado, with wind speeds of between 158 and 206 mph. An F3 tornado can cause significant damage to well-built homes,
            overturn vehicles, and uproot trees. <br>
            
            Some examples of the damage that an F3 tornado can cause include: <br>
            
            - Homes with significant damage to roofs and exterior walls <br>
            - Large trees uprooted or snapped at the base <br>
            - Vehicles thrown and displaced <br>
            - Power poles and lines knocked down <br>
            - Significant damage to commercial buildings and warehouses
            
            F3 tornadoes are less common than weaker tornadoes, but they are still capable of causing significant destruction. It is
            important to take tornado warnings seriously and to take appropriate shelter when necessary, regardless of the strength
            of the tornado.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">F4 tornado</h5>
            <p class="card-text">An F4 tornado is a type of tornado that is categorized as "devastating" on the Fujita scale. It is considered a strong
            to violent tornado, with wind speeds of between 207 and 260 mph. An F4 tornado can cause catastrophic damage, destroying
            well-built homes, lifting cars off the ground and throwing them, and stripping the bark off trees. <br>
            
            Some examples of the damage that an F4 tornado can cause include: <br>
        
            
            - Homes and other buildings completely leveled or swept away <br>
            - Cars and other vehicles thrown and tossed like toys <br>
            - Large trees snapped and uprooted <br>
            - Heavy machinery such as trains or planes flipped over or thrown a considerable distance <br>
            - Concrete structures severely damaged or destroyed <br>
            
            F4 tornadoes are less common than weaker tornadoes and typically occur in smaller areas, but they are among the most
            powerful natural disasters on the planet. It is crucial to heed tornado warnings and take shelter in a safe place
            immediately when a warning is issued, regardless of the tornado's strength.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">F5 tornado</h5>
            <p class="card-text">An F5 tornado is the most powerful and devastating type of tornado on the Fujita scale. It is categorized as
            "incredible," with wind speeds of over 261 mph. An F5 tornado can cause complete destruction of well-built homes and
            buildings, uprooting of trees and even causing the deformation of steel-reinforced concrete structures. <br>
            
            Some examples of the damage that an F5 tornado can cause include: <br>
            
            - Houses and other structures swept away, with only the foundation left <br>
            - Cars and trucks tossed around like toys and carried great distances <br>
            - Trees debarked and stripped of branches <br>
            - Strong frame houses lifted off their foundations and leveled <br>
            - Massive objects such as boats, aircraft, and even trains tossed around <br>
            
            F5 tornadoes are rare but incredibly powerful and deadly, capable of causing catastrophic damage and loss of life. It is
            crucial to take all warnings seriously and seek shelter immediately when a tornado warning is issued, especially if it
            is an F5 tornado.</p>

<h1 class="safe"> Safety tips</h1>
<br>
 <p class="safe">Here are some safety tips that can help you stay safe during a tornado: <br>

1. Stay informed: Monitor local weather conditions and watch for tornado warnings. Listen to local radio or TV stations
for updates and follow the advice of local authorities. <br>

2. Have a plan: Develop a tornado safety plan with your family or coworkers. Identify safe locations in your home or
workplace where you can take shelter during a tornado.<br>

3. Know where to go: In a home, seek shelter in a basement, storm cellar, or an interior room on the lowest level of the
house, away from windows. In a workplace or public building, follow the directions of emergency personnel and go to the
designated shelter areas.<br>

4. Stay away from windows: Tornado winds can cause broken glass and debris to fly through windows, which can cause
serious injuries.<br>

5. Protect your head: If you can't get to shelter, protect your head with your arms or with a helmet, a pillow, or a
blanket.<br>

6. Stay put: Once you're in a safe location, stay there until the tornado has passed and the all-clear signal has been
given.<br>

7. Stay informed: After the tornado has passed, listen to local radio or TV stations for updates on the situation and
follow the advice of local authorities.<br>

Remember that tornadoes can strike quickly and without warning, so it is essential to be prepared and take appropriate
action as soon as you hear a tornado warning or see signs of a tornado. Stay alert, stay safe, and always take tornado
warnings seriously.</p>
